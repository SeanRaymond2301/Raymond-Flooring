    <h1>About Me: Matthew Raymond</h1>
    <p>I started in the floor covering business with my dad installing carpet in 1985. I installed carpet with him until one day we opened a very small store. There I learned the supply and sales aspect of the flooring industry. In 1995 I left his business and staretd working for various companies. My knowledge of installing carpet was expanded throughout the years.</p>

    <p>In 1999, I wanted to break out of carpet and attend school to learn how to install laminate flooring. When I finished attending school I obtained my California Contractor's License #768883. I started subcontracting work from my dad's store while going out and obtaining more accounts installing laminate flooring. Within a couple of years, I partnered up with a man who taught me how to install engineered Hradwood flooring. We worked together for awhile until the recession hit. At that time we went our seperate ways.</p>

    <p>Since then the market has shifted; vinyl plank or waterproof core flooring has become more popular. Vinyl plank installs just like laminate flooring so it was a natural fit for me. Today, my business is all about being honest and doing it right the first time. Unlike other labor shops that subcontract from retailers, I pride myself in getting the customer first. I educate them on the best choices for their home instead of selling them something they don't need. You won't just get a descriptive quote, but also an explaination of what it will take to do the job.</p>

    <p>The future is all about keeping my business going in a positive direction, and my customers satisfaction.</p>
